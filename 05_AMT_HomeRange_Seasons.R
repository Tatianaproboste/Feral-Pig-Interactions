# using different data set created with different thresholds.
# Here we wanted to determine which animals overlap their home range
# within the direct and indirect networks and also by season.

    month %in% c(3, 4, 5) ~ "Autumn",
    month %in% c(6, 7, 8) ~ "Winter",
    month %in% c(9, 10, 11) ~ "Spring"
